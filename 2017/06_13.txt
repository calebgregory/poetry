She was fine with comb erasure
I reached final measure
Leisurely seed the conic desset
Weed the croquet court, abrasive

Mom said Sears was selling Adidas at a discount
I'll check the catalog and call the outlet mall

Is it wrong, the way we're going on like this?
But I guess there's no man in the sky

Margaret called yesterday
She said you were back from Japan
that it changed the way you saw the States
Even colder than before, and more malnourished
Shivering in air conditioning and fat
Polaroid of me in front of window, staring at trapezoid light on floor

Do you personify gravity?
Why do you personify desire?
Squiggly neuron handshake, like seaweed squeezed into a bag

Verifiable, tattooed in flame
Wearing a cowboy hat on Broadway
Stoops to pick up floating Thank You bag, places it in trashcan
Camera phone video of me at brushed steel table
writing note to shop online for psychadelic patterned clothing

John left a note in your locker again
He told me it keeps you alive
Like the beer billboard says,
Responsibility.

They put words in your mouth
I watched it happen, I saw them do it
You were dead, so you didn't notice
But I wished something awful you were alive to correct them
They put a sword in your hand, too, and they kept you up on the cross
And carried you through the streets to scare their children

I thought it was beautiful that you fantasized about the future
while I was mulling over the past
After the solar eclipse, you saw technology advance
enabling tourist trap trips to the sun
I saw an evolving mythology to solve why the sun went black
And the terror move the dead ones' feet to dance

I asked for my credit card back
after the great Schizm when the papacy split
You returned it
I used it to buy a pack of cigarettes, smoked one then threw the rest away
Never thought about whether John saw this coming
It didn't really feel like that mattered, then

The General finished his tenure
We celebrated at the university garden next to the dog park
It was funny, his eyes seemed darker
You spilled your wine on my back when we hugged
You didn't notice and I didn't tell you

The last time we got lunch at Crumbs'
You didn't stir the cream in your coffee
You jolted when I asked you to pass the salt
It hurt my feelings

But we are one and we are two
That much is irresolvable
I don't know whose joke we are in
But I do know whose laughter
