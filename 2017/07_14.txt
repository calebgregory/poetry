she was a bone explosion written in four parts on
railways sideways and open to the new nude groove of
Danny Glover starring in Beloved, where wet heat smothered,
cicadas humming in the background and zoom slowly at a shout
to startle the babies sleeping in the spine
to turn and adjust ; the luster is well worn by her
the kitten purs and curls its neck into her palm
and licks the grass against its nose in praise of her pulse
that thumps the skull to sleep
while under, in the ground, beetles fumble with the dirt and we hope for better weather
i think i should have said it sooner, even could have written a letter,
somehow it never felt like the right time, but the bright dime
that hangs in your dashboard will buy us grace once more, and wind will whip us clean
so lean in for a kiss again and bend to kiss the kitten head
ween yourself from sternness and learn to let the wetness mess your shirttails up

the stairwell swells with pages pushing hard into the shelves cavernous
as babies sleep, the wrongs are writ in blood on yellowed paper
a record of labor, working double shifts from 9 to 9
the log of a journey, the path a fibrous braid of jerky turning
burning the layman brain into a knot, a fishing net to capture men
a map of hell, a love note that reads, "don't go here.
this ground, it is well covered. do something else;
believe me, we already took care of it."
with a withered postcard picture of our great grandmother framed
and thumbing beads to memorize the massacres and flames
break the bread to transubstantiate our maker's shame
and when the carbon air is there and we have no more twigs or leaves
we will rip the pages free to catch the last sparks we can eat

so taper your pantlegs smooth, I told you once, you're clean
unlearn neurotic words like dirty - do you remember when that meant nothing?
purity of heart, perfection - these are ways of being, ways of seeing with full absorption.
perfection - it's not a standard you are against.
it was a midgame rule-change for the losing team's advantange -
they took the word and changed its meaning to con you into believing you are wrong,
but not so.
just deceived by those who were deceived by those who were deceived by those
and closing in on a picture of a depiction of an affinity for making fiction
we watch the maker stitch the situation grave and full of mind
we tear the rind free from the fruit and squeeze the juice into the flame
always wondering what went wrong
in the invisible mental space that floats between us
why the social is not as it should be,
though we are hopeful because we have to...
full of mind, severed and blind like fingernails full of dirt when -
here comes a brush and a clipper

and slipping backwards against the pants pressed flat, we laugh
because forever shakes hands between our eyes and I cannot dive deep enough into your mouth
the shallow cave with creek for tongue, can I spelunk your crouch to sleep?
game over -
can I eat you? can I take your mass inside myself?
your flesh my food will flavor make you
body, blood, your molecules interlaced with mine in a finetoothed muscular tangle -
a rat jumps quick at me and you twitch to protect me from teeth
to not recall the claw mark rips i gave you
i only needed it to happen once, to satify my curiosity
"don't put your thumb in my windpipe; I only don't want the blood"
and as the ladder floods you fit with gravity, unlatching rungs to crash down your pit
you writhe in unreality, this world comprised of us
is it our justice? our answer to this mess?
our slipping and collapsing collision? our justice? our response? our gift?
