Hand reach into sternum, thumping lung on thumbnail
Peeling knot off of ribbone:  I am one again.

You settle into my crevasse, a heart upside down will not subside
The size is wasted without the placed graceful mat lessen gravity's cruel pull.
Buried fear into your muscles, breaks my heart -
Hold your temple to my breast, graze your lips thoughtlessly as a baby, fresh mind free of worry.
Klimt the kiss, bent broken back made room for wings to sprout
We fly above the house between the branches, watch stick bugs algorithmic canter
Marumba mallot hands, playing each footstep in relative rhythm
Erratic like bugs do, conforming to a short interval
We recognize the rhythm, greet it and bow closed-eyed
And float further toward the fire tower
To survey the sunken hillsides

When an ice cap melted, size of city, threw us down into its ocean
Collapsing splash beside you, the earth cried birthing pains - humans
These humans stretching mark my womb
These humans cut themselves out
Garbage blocks canal, then they sharpen their knives

Can I love even this? Am I capable of it?
Earth asks Earthself.
I ask myself: "Am I prepared to face
the possibility that the best possible outcome could require my extermination?"
