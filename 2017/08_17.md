I am deep inside you.

A soul has decided it wants to exist.
It turns your eye toward me. Now your eye has caught me.
It draws you near me. We orbit, two suns at the rim of a black hole.

I breathe your breath. I lick the sweat off your neck.

I am in your bed. I am smashing myself into you, unable to smash myself sufficiently deep enough.
If I had no bones, you could shove me inside of you like a sleeping bag in a rucksack.

I stop humping and hold myself inside you. You are writhing.
My capillaries root in your soil.

What is this soul that has smashed me into you,
coaxing my swimming seed toward your egg, unfettered like a faun,
wrapping us around itself, clothing made of human flesh,
because it has decided it wants to move matter and disrupt?
