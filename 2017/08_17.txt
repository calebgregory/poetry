I am deep inside you.

A soul has decided it wants to exist.
It turns your eye toward me. Now I am caught in your eye.
It draws you near me. We orbit, two suns at the rim of a black hole.

I breathe your breath. I lick the sweat off your neck.

I am in your bed. I am smashing myself into you, unable to smash myself deep enough.
If I had no bones, you could shove me inside of you like a sleeping bag in a rucksack.

I stop humping and hold myself inside you. You are writhing.
I am deep inside of you, my capillaries rooting in your soil.

Who is this soul that has smashed me into you,
coaxing like a faun my swimming seed toward your egg,
wrapping us around itself as animal cloathing
because it has decided it wants to move and to disrupt?
