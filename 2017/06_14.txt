Kevin handed me an apple at Canaveral
His cheek spoke, "Take this and eat."
I punctured your skin and ripped you.
Your juice ran between my teeth.
I am reading the red in the ocean,
watching bubbles humping me doubly
both at the filmy boundary of air
and on undulate ocean floor locally.

Now I am on and gnawing,
lost in the surf's shallow shadows -
Kevin warns me, "Don't eat the core,"
, _, Caught between a need for correction, and wanting
not to come across as stern.

He is being underutilized.

Call your local Eraser.
When she answers, ask for Kevin.
He is likely to be in.

Her cigarette points to noon tonight:
Amendments are trembling, the result of resembling,
assembling our marriage of matter and soul like trout of the shoal.

How can she be plurality,
and at that the same time, show she is One?

Meanwhile, opportunities to forgive remain
as constant and functional as flexion.

Our dreams, they are resting in essential protection -
not as of a line drawn by a hand,
or as bounded by landmark ribbons
extrinsically given by interested parties.
But as the basil leaf becomes, in soil and sun,
caught in a dance of immense integration.
Drawing its environment into, and forming itself
from the matter that gathers around it.
Where boundary is porous, an exchange of a chorus singing song encoded deep in the cell.

To dig deeper to soil, to stretch further toward sun:
absorbing and reflecting, essentially protecting
a container of exactly itself.
