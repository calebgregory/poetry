Kevin handed me a fugi apple at Canaveral
His cheek spoke, "Take this and eat."
I punctured your skin and ripped you.
Your juice ran between my teeth.
I am reading the red in the ocean,
watching the bubbles humping doubly
beneath the boundary of air,
superimposed on my vision.
I am on and gnawing, lost in the surf's shallow shadows -
Kevin warns me not to eat the core,
Caught between a feeling of obligation to commit the kindness of correction
and wanting not to come across as stern.

I am being underutilized.
Call your local Eraser.
When she answers, ask for me.
I am likely to be in.

Her cigarette points to noon tonight:
Amendments are trembling, the result of resembling,
assembling our marriage of matter and soul like trout of the shoal.
How can I convey plurality,
while simultaneously connoting I am speaking of One?

While these opportunities to forgive remain
as constant and functional as flexion.

When dreams, they are resting in essential protection -
not as of a hand, or as bounded by landmark ribbons
extrinsicly given by interested parties.
But as the basil leaf becomes, in soil and sun,
caught in a dance of immense integration.
Drawing its environment into, and thereby forming itself
from the matter that surrounds it.

To dig deeper to soil, to stretch further toward sun
and becoming a hair on a tongue, it tickles imagination
rooting into association - it becomes known.
