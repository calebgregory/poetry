// July browns like a banana skin blended, smudged, and bruised

Who are you? Why do you hang on to the anxiety in your bones like a barter of tuck?
The motion groans in you, the painful clings to you.
Keep up. The flow is struggle, but buttercups await for you.
When first passes the moment, we put the sunset away,
Suitcase it and place it beneath the earth in its sunken vessel.
We drizzle the dress of the nestled waitress weightless for you.
The birth cup churned and spurned the worriers to wait for you:
Stay home today. We cannot have you here. Not today. Our loved one travels near.
I sent them away. But now suddenly I stand corrected.
In a murder of mirror turning we are learning what needs unlearning.
As our burning heart peels apart, our ripped wrists to expose the blue.
What have I done? You will not say, just send me away into my corner. I shut myself up.
We cannot kiss when your temper whips awake the beast in you.
It screeches tunnel vision, your sight incisioning a subset of myself with scappel knife.
Have mercy, let me be with my mistake - ok, I get there's pain. And I'm here for you.
But I also know if you zoomed in you'd see the state I'm in. It's all I can do to keep breathing.
I am bleeding, my uncle died and all I've cried have been spare tears while reading
and listening to another's grieving.
Whatever I've done, I want to know - I am not afraid of being
a creature that makes mistakes. Our motion can collide, perhaps that's what we're seeing.
Have mercy, let me be with my mistake. You just sent a painful screech into my tunnel.
But all you see is a flash of light within the circle, reflected sound of car driving, inside a cold concrete barrel.
And all I see is that much of you, too.
I'd hope if we had the whole of the other's picture we'd end up mutually holding, emboldening our strife for substantial solidarity.
I think that's forgiveness: a preemptive decision to empathize and relax.
An acknowledgment that you and I are the same thing, and that it's better for us to be together than apart.
I do not want to scatter or be scattered, divisive or incisive.
I want to give water to the thirsty herbs, to see our faces flowering.
All we should be devouring is the sight of each other, smothered in our lovers and friendly animals
covered in vines that fall from branches tall, allowed to grow into their prime.
Batteries - who changed the batteries last? Someone get up and change the channel.
