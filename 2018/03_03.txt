animated gif of polar bear starving
the delayed change in the temp range
feeling summer sweat somewhat still on solemn brow,
and it's in the end of september,
stumbling round my windowed house, wide open
wondering how bad we've already made it.
but...
resist complacency, lessen waste while we
wait a bit and see the troubled evidence roll in.

meanwhile memorizing sounds of bugs and birds,
their crazy song a cranky urgent call:
come quickly my dear let's do this dance before i'm own and over!
the stove is piping hot, hear me shake my skeleton maracas,
hypnotize you toward my center
follow accelerando rhythm to our mutual remaking
while the sun lays down a red glaze on the rim of the sky
let's get this hive a-blazing...

grass blade on grass blade in the breeze played by the blues made
conquer nothing, son, you have nothing to prove
gifted electrical circuit embedded in an obedient flesh vessel
wrestling with madness in an apocalypse that is imminent
your death:  a single synapse out in an entire thriving nervous
your death:  just an incense cherry finally ceasing smoke
your death:  but, understand my son, there are so many others
the work will be done, i said
grass blade on grass blade: tiny sound, loud found in abundance

while the howling chewing mouths drip spit from the corners onto the table
and ask you where your favorite restaurant is and do you like this burger
and the A/C fans cooling the air contained by the wonky sky blue buildings,
suits with men inside them, knives scraping the southern sky
blocking the sun from the hedges, a new modern form of rudeness
and the whining cancer of traffic in the classic urbanization
tricky kid, your bit is hidden in an unforgiving nation
ice melting, fresh water into the atlantic breaking the cycle
will it be a new ice age page for my daughter?  should i even bother to learn how to garden?

meanwhile memorizing sounds of dry leaves
papering fragile but still holding
the bristle edges on the branches sound brown
tomorrow, maybe the next day,
pulled to the ground and ground into pieces
digested, simplified into carbon
to be pulled by the grass of next season
to turn green in the spring in an evening quiet, without any need for inspection
