And closing in on a picture of a depiction of an affinity for making fiction
We watch the maker stitch the situation grave and full of mind
Binding body to brain, statically change with an old personal delimitation
Kept track: that this is mine; I am this, not that.
Inside / out - out: that, in: this. Round, flat. Cold, hot. Land, map.

Then shall I freeze it stamped with placcard, mount it on limestone stand, and name it: Samus.
But it's never the same, falls like waterlogged sand through finger cracked in hand
On suntanned thigh poofed with fat this winter laughed: Seamus (Shame-us).
Burgered, grease napkins clapping lips flap chicken wing dingus
Peppercorn particle stuck in left cuticle, beautiful beside bedside baseball stadium.

Lover giggles near to me, under arm and over waist, my duffle buddy
In my cuddly clutch I near to nuzzling touch our noses
The cozy woke will soften, still you
Birds will feel your breath stir their murmuration
Trails of bloody steak juice, bits of grit in soggy fries
Her words like tea leaves turning, steeped in a heady wakeful
Leaves trembling heavily in heavenly rake full of roots and clumps of kisses
The starlit branch misses your rump and plunder

Now, go under to the soily severance where person nevermore reaches
Nor breaches the sunken silence, your brain unstuck from skull
Your eyes have sunk away from lid and tongue relaxed at root
Jaw open, teeth hanging: no need to keep it tightened when there's light inside your ribs
Beneath your ever blessed sternum
Benificient

Saints start at their own stupidity. Ending at a young candle flame, breeze through window flickers.
