high wall highway winder
desert driveway drags you,
snagged like strand of blanket on a bushthorn
tickling the sandy breeze with a shiver.

we wind the snake street yellow line
crumbly walled Topanga
with Neil Young on the weekend, while
I'm on the verge of leaving.

I feel your heartbeat in my chest
my chest walls gather around it
like shadow hands of forest,
handsy trees with twisted smiles.
dopamine hit from Instagram like
paying others to make your food,
a life of luxury: consume
while
working harder for a living.
dopamine hit from Instagram like
expensive cups of coffee
accelerating to the redlight fast
and pushing harder the brakes

this makeshift world doesn't need you
no one really belongs there
our culture myth can trap you
stuck inside your performance
crowding pals around you
photos for the network
facial recognition
nuanced brand adjustments
like every breath is a statement

it's a trap, my friend.
they will trap you -
the shadow selves assembled
from faces formed by glamour,
designed to spark your envy.

you're recovering.
take cover.
heal.

joyful kid, joy laugh was born
in birthday candle blow out:
you closed your eyes in perfect silence
eyelids smooth, even reverent
as you made your birthday Wish.
a true-believer in life's full-circle
atuned to the magic above the cake
while light was bent by heat
while flames turned into air
a halo formed within you
candle flame of adoration:
a kid, a laugh, a dream:
to be played, be danced, to flow freely -
to concretize the imagined -

we round the desert corner
are smacked with face of ocean -
what the fuck just happened?
inland dry dog canyon empties out Pacific Ocean
dirt, thorns, dust, tumble
and here's this massive blue that's shimmering
utterly unexpected

"do you want your put your feet in the ocean?"

thank you for this moment.

we park.
we scramble to the beach.
I catch you on my acetate,
the light waves bouncing off you
into my old film camera
to make a chemical memory
and save you from electric.

we fade.
we age and fade.
the front page of the mirror
receding hairline caught your pride
like LA vibes have caught you
but you're living in the caney-yin (canyon)
whenever you are able.
remember to remember that
you choose the way you struggle.

twins of fate, two sons of southland
mountain and tornado
our egos bound, the crust around the rim of eye while waking.
and as we churn our stories, learning what we need forgetting
I cool the flame of chest cramp heart
with breath and balm and bedtime herbs
and the calm descent of forehead
while my ribs make crescent moons
to calm you and to give us rest
so we can sing our songs into ether.

eye contact at the airport sun
where you are dropping me off

"I love you, man."

I love you, too.
