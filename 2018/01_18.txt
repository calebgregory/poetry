Discretion is advised
It might take more than twice
To get that hot lead through your cold skull
Say why did go to school
Question curriculum
What teach of ancient scrolls
Wet teacher thick and full of
Innocence while she survives
Oh, true she could set free
Oh, too true she would let be
Your inhibition shell you built
For mom and dad to bounce off well
We can see through that, too, now
Let sun expose our smiling faces
Lift your ribs, kid, there is light that could erase it
Wash it exposed, white and vacant
Stop with stuck and wishing
To shop to sell the stitching
Broken self assembled in mirror
After washing hands, in phone camera land
Mind racing so fast it gets dull
Cold cell for the new you
Retract and tighten shoe crew
Left behind the kind of kid you found at New Years

Laugh it off with us
Enhance the sense of humor in grimmest of times
Grim times, grim fn times
Laught it off with us in the grimmest of times

You know fly philosophy
Suspend riddler costs and see
Let the finger tapping guide you
Across the hemisphere divide
Symmetric motion will confide
Electric signal self, you're lightning waiting to be set free
So shoot it out your fingernails
Unfold chest, let frozen melt
Unspell your name, move with us beyond masky maze
Beyond personhood to find
Unearthed rebirthed the perfect rhyme
We shared, we all shared
So shoot it out for flapping throat
Flaying like piano keys
On waves, your waves will move us soaked

Then laugh it off with us
Enhance sense of humor in friendest of times
Friend times, friend fn times
Laugh it off in the friendest of times
