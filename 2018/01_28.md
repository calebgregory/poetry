Two partners walk after the still of the sun setting over the spilling
It fills them with retrograde notions
In motion toward the glittering Ford 150 F 84 biting, an allegoric story they're writing
on mud flap with mitten-cloaked hand in a rock dust blue chalk smear on rubber

With flubber rubbed onto their shoes through basketball gym they are citing
New resources found through the winter
When trees were branch boney and tidy, polite like a cigarette lighting
an old trap for new friend inviting to birthday party just having met you
with wet shoes clumbering puddles in the mud room by the bicycle pump and the subsumed futon they'll love
Those mitten-cloaked hands under gloves the finger holes crammed with black cotton

They are rotten in the wooden squeak stands with the butter stain popcorn on grip tape
Ripping cape off of Superman model who often was more trouble than mighty
Their little niece puts on her nighty and crawls into bed with book and a favor to ask
The bombastic adults should be readers
We feel the pulp pull of the paper on the glove that is rough and forgotten

The plot in F 150 is curmudgeon and exact
Like a passive pecan chewed up in an old digestive tract
The chosen is an illusion, that's what I would like to think
Despite all my willful wishing when I'm at the kitchen sink

And closing in on a picture of a depiction of an affinity for making fiction
We watch the maker stitch the situation grave and full of mind
Binding body to brain, statically change with an old personal delimitation
Kept track: charted a map, an atlas of stats, that this is mine; I am not that.

Then shall I freeze it stamped with placcard, mount it on limestone stand, and name it: Samus.
But it's never the same, falls like waterlogged sand through finger cracked in hand
On suntanned thigh poofed with fat this winter laughed: Seamus (Shame-us).
The beach trip burgered, grease napkins clapping lips flap like chicken wing dingus
Peppercorn particle stuck in left cuticle, beautiful beside bedside baseball stadium.
Ketchup fills our noses, some smeared onto nauseous phone screen
Napkin caught by wind, sends it overturning swiftly.

Lover giggles near to me, under an arm, my duffle buddy
In a room composed of bedsheets, the cozy yoke within her
Birds will feel her breath within them and it stir their murmuration
Her words like tea leaves turning, thunder stomping out in the trees,
incense weaves her angel dances, eyelid steeped in a heady wakeful.
Leaves trembling heavily in heavenly rake full of roots and clumps of kisses
The starlit branch told me it misses her unimpeachable rump and plunder

Now, go under to the soily severance where a person nevermore reaches
Nor breaches the sunken silence, your brain isn't stuck to your skull
Your eyes have sunk away from lid and tongue relaxed at root
Jaw open, teeth hanging: no need to keep it tightened when there's light inside your ribs
Beneath your ever blessed sternum
Beneficient

Saints start at their own stupidity. Ending at a young candle flame, breeze through window flickers.
