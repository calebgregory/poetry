Healer instrumentation
Cast compression of introspecting
Levitate toward front door and window
Thoughts are trails of storied gunsmoke
Clumps of snow on rails of porch swing
Thing emergent crystal castle
Circuit is in tact, a fractal
Blasted
Smashed through space casually

We, riding rock
A rotated crop, combinatorial bits of xistence

An arm reach from the soil
Physics masters back again

Feed, child, feed and breathe
Till the gathered earth will take you
And who like a dealer, rakes you.
Our soft gardener awaits you - Please, child: Decompose again.

Gravity will take you
And will like a wheel awake you
Lo, bell of steel forsakes your golden dream was rose again.

Wipe the dust off your eyes. We've waited long and solemn
To show sunkissed kid the walking stars, free from cloud and column.
Moon are lover set in lockets
Violet torn in midnight visions
When were photographed as children
Locked in a posture weeping beneath nautical doctor lights and wet
Graduate to freshman beds and breath
Her root woke by bite on earlobe
With the rancid sweat of August
Clothes on floor, closet door is closed
Chickadee knock in tree is chipper
Graduate to constellation, bright red threads are strung between them
In a warm, slow mo rotation
In a comPlete conNected Graph in Laughing Kid's iMagination
Graduate to she's on fire, how she deep in sheet exploding
Whipping flame out snap and back in slow dive mountain flame unfolding
Red and blue between her

A mass - a writhing mass -
Over time is living
Combinatorial bits of xistence
In exchange of giving
Me to you, your breath in me
Mutual creation
Mutagen, your breath in me
breathing While inSide this Station.
