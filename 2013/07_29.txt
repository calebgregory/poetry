your sudden piercing headache
in the heart of the earth underneath it all
breaking the cries of the children
against your knee to put in the fire
to fuel the flood
a diesel engine with a heart of diamonds
living organism
the *child of ideal*
and the waves keep breaking
against stones of relief
and your yawning common ancestors
keep going instinct,
yellow bastards
in a dream god tied you up like a
string on a bow
and the tension was disasterous
when your spinal cord broke
then the demons with their pitchforks
and the angel's arrows
came through the fog to arrest you,
a boy dressed in girl's clothes

you get 3 wishes
but you have to tell me them now.

batman      sinners in the hands of an angry god
you were dressed in the royal
heads of muppets and talking deli sandwiches
a permanent record for god's
filing cabinet by the pearly gates
only judas has the key to
(yes judas finally made it in -
who would
who could eternally begrudge the
second most important character in the story?
humans might, but god is too good for that)
and beside your dental records
was the locket your boyfriend gave you,
empty and unforgotten
you lost it but angels
kept it there for you
with all your treasured belongings
(who would
who could begrudge you of your earthly life
after your discovered the truth -
that heaven was a bedtime story
you told yourself all your life
somewhere in your bedroom mind
like the ghosts of striped light
on your walls in the evening and early
night?)
god will judge you by the amount of
covers you can grab to cover your
head before he comes to get you
since jesus died and you don't need to
paint lamb's blood on your door posts
anymore
what is the greatest sin of all?
to know the truth, to float avove
the artifacts of words, to transcend
death and the idea
and to settle in the sediment again.
