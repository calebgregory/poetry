you are past your limit
the best is yet to come
do you believe in the advancement
of life - the progress of maturation
who handed you your conjugal crown of
thorns
in the afterbirth of the twentieth century?
the elements could string you up to a
tree
you hear them rustling in the attic
the muffled footsteps of lineage
and the ancient spell of time
seduces you so you
breathe jesus breath and spit
lucifer blood
but backwards in the headboard
the heart beats itself to sleep
the rock of quartz sings you your dreams
and you hope never to wake up,
your alarm clock already set,
if you ever do fall asleep.
the pocketbook is weeping
your stomach yelling obscenities
and your nutsack has given up all hope
at least your gave managed to stay clean -
not that you had so many opportunities
for infection
with your anonymous visits to the state
health department where in the waiting
room with the soap opera directing verbal
traffic of the gays & the blacks
you felt so alive,
so centered,
so fully embracing your sickness
knowing you were in perfect health
underneath the blinded windows
between magazine tables and fake trees
but how well was the lawn mowed
and the folden grass styck between your toes
and when she took your blood your thanked her
and you meant it
and you felt good in the afterbirth -
it is healthy to be grateful -
and you thanked her for colored condoms
like swedish fish in your pockets
always doublechecking if they jumped free
to land on her parents' kitchen hardwood
and your were only embarassed seconds later
when you remembered where you were.
is this body open?
is this laser disc broken?
your tummy oven will learn to write...
the backyard pines bend in repose
blinking in the light
for the on-looking windows
of the neighbor dead-pan staring...
oh, there are stars here
and a fairer morning chorus
of muffled midnigh cranking
through egg-shell pink shadows
the sound of summer starlight
dim as waves in sleepy eyelids
those darmn crickets make a stillness
that tingles across bare skin...
are you in or out, damn cricket?
i cannot leave it to you to decide
always pausing for breath
at the most erratic times.
